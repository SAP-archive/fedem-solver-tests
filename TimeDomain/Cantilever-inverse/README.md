# Test description

The model is a 2D cantilever beam consisting of 4 beam elements and 5 triads,
subjected to unknown loads (shear force and bending moment) at the tip triad.

The loads are calculated from the direct inverse method based on measured
transverse displacements through sensors on Triads 2 and 4.

Six different scenarios are tested:

* Inverse: Zero gravity, quasi-static solution,
           sensor displacements from hard-coded sine functions
* Inverse-zeroG: Zero gravity, quasi-static solution,
                 sensor displacements read from `Master-zeroG.asc`
* Inverse-Gravity: With gravity, quasi-static solution,
                   sensor displacements read from `Master-normalG.asc`
* Inverse-Dynamic: Zero gravity, dynamic solution,
                   sensor displacements from hard-coded sine functions
* Inverse-Dynamic: With gravity, dynamic solution,
                   sensor displacements from hard-coded sine functions
* Inverse-Joint: Same as Inverse-Gravity, but the model now has a free joint
                 at the tip, such that the loads are imposed via joint DOFs
                 instead of the triad DOFs

In the 1st, 4th and 5th case the "hard-coded sine functions" that are used as
sensor readings are `0.02*sin(2*PI*t)` in Triad 2, and `0.003*sin(2*PI*t)` in Triad 4.
See the source file [testInverse.C](https://github.com/SAM/fedem-solvers/blob/main/src/vpmSolver/vpmSolverTests/testInverse.C) around line 157.

For the 2nd and 3rd test, the sensor displacements are instead read from the
respective files `Master-zeroG.asc` and `Master-normalG.asc` which contain the
triad positions of the "master"-simulations (representing the physical asset in
a Digital Twin setup) that were conducted with known tip forces.
This is achieved by specifying the command-line arguments `-dfunc <ID1> <ID2>`
when running the test program where `<ID1>` and `<ID2>` are the user-IDs of the
two functions reading the displacment from file. The two loads in the
"master"-simulations are linear w.r.t. time, i.e., `V=10000*t` (shear force)
and `M=5000*t` (bending moment).

# Response data

* Y-positions vs. time for Triads 2 to 5.

The response in each case is compared against reference data from a respective
"master"-simulation. In the tests where two sine functions are used as sensor
displacements, the same displacemens were imposed as prescribed motions in the
"master"-simulation and with no other external loads.
