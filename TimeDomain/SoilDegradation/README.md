# Test description

The model consists of a cylindrical beam divided into two elements,
which are connected to the ground with soil springs in Free joints.
The test verifies the integrity for the soil spring calculation.

# Response data

* Soil spring deflection at mid-point vs. time
* Soil spring force at mid-point vs. time
* Soil spring stiffness at mid-point vs. time
* Soil spring secant stiffness at mid-point vs. time
* Pile top position vs. time
